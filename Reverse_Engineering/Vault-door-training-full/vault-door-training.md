# VAULT DOOR TRAINING
> Đây là một series khá hay với độ phức tạp tăng dần
###### Tags: `picoCTF 2021` `Reverse Engineering`
### DESCRIPTION
##### Your mission is to enter Dr. Evil's laboratory and retrieve the blueprints for his Doomsday Project. The laboratory is protected by a series of locked vault doors. Each door is controlled by a computer and requires a password to open. Unfortunately, our undercover agents have not been able to obtain the secret passwords for the vault doors, but one of our junior agents obtained the source code for each vault's computer! You will need to read the source code for each level to figure out what the password is for that vault door. As a warmup, we have created a replica vault in our training facility. The source code for the training vault is here: [VaultDoorTraining.java](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/1afdf83322ee9c0040f8e3a3c047e18b/VaultDoorTraining.java)
### Đọc hiểu code
```java
// The password is below. Is it safe to put the password in the source code?
    // What if somebody stole our source code? Then they would know what our
    // password is. Hmm... I will think of some ways to improve the security
    // on the other doors.
    //
    // -Minion #9567
    public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
        return password.equals("w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_eec0716b713");
    }
```
##### + Như vậy, có được mật khẩu `w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_eec0716b713`, chạy chương trình với format `picoCTF{..}` để xác nhận mật khẩu:
```bash
$ javac VaultDoorTraining.java 
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true
$ java VaultDoorTraining
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true
Enter vault password: picoCTF{w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_eec0716b713}
Access granted.
```
##### + Lầy flag thành công!
